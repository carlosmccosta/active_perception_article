\section{\uppercase{Conclusions}}\label{sec:conclusions}

\noindent The proposed system is able to estimate the N best sensors disposition for maximizing the observable surface coverage area percentage for a given set of target objects

With a low sensor count the system can compute the best sensor disposition in less than a second, which makes it suitable for active perception tasks

Future work would include the testing of the proposed approach in conjunction with a object recognition system in order to reliably perform object tracking when an operator is manipulating a target object (by moving the sensor within the environment using a robotic arm)

Further research for fast object tracking recovery could include the modeling of the interaction between the target objects and a simulated hand in order to keep an approximate object pose even if it is almost completely occluded
