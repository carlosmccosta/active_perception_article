\noindent 3D object recognition is a challenging task that may require active perception of the environment for gathering additional sensor information when the level of confidence in the perception analysis is not enough

Simulating sensor 3D depth data from a set of representative environments can help decide the type, number and disposition of sensors that maximize the target objects observable surface area
